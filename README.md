```swift
import ActiveLabelSwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ActiveLabelView(
            text: "Hello @ali! Visit https://apple.com or use #SwiftUI",
            onOpenLink: { url in
                print("Tapped URL: \(url)")
            },
            onTapMention: { mention in
                print("Tapped Mention: \(mention)")
            },
            onTapHashtag: { hashtag in
                print("Tapped Hashtag: \(hashtag)")
            }
        )
        .padding()
    }
}
```

### Basic Example Precomputing Attributed String (for performance)

```swift
import ActiveLabelSwiftUI

let attributed = ActiveLabelView.makeAttributedString(
    "Welcome @Ali to #iOSDev. Check https://github.com!",
    font: .systemFont(ofSize: 16),
    textColor: .label,
    linkColor: .blue
)

Text(attributed)
    .onTapGesture {
        // Tap detection won't work here directly
        // Use ActiveLabelView for tap handling
    }
```
